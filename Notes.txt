If you’re interested, run the command-line client for your database and type \dt (PostgreSQL),
SHOW TABLES; (MariaDB, MySQL), .tables (SQLite), or SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM USER_TABLES; (Oracle)
to display the tables Django created.

In our poll app, we’ll create two models:
Question and Choice.
A Question has a question and a publication date.
A Choice has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally.
Each Choice is associated with a Question.

Django apps are “pluggable”: You can use an app in multiple projects, and you can distribute apps,
because they don’t have to be tied to a given Django installation.

By running makemigrations, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models
There’s a command that will run the migrations for you and manage your database schema automatically - that’s called migrate

By convention DjangoTemplates looks for a “templates” subdirectory in each of the INSTALLED_APPS.

Namespacing URL names:
The tutorial project has just one app, polls. In real Django projects, there might be five, ten, twenty apps or more.
How does Django differentiate the URL names between them?
For example, the polls app has a detail view, and so might an app on the same project that is for a blog.
How does one make it so that Django knows which app view to create for a url when using the {% url %} template tag?
